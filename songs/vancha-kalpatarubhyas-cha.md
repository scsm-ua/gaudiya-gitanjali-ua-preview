    ва̄ньчха̄-калпатарубгʼяс’ ча
        крипа̄-сіндгубгʼя ева ча
    патіта̄на̄м па̄ванебгйо
        вайшнавебгйо намо намах

I bow down unto the holy feet of the pure Vaiṣṇavas, who are like desire trees able to fulfil all the devotees’ aspirations. The Lord’s devotees are comparable to a vast ocean of causeless mercy, as they deliver the fallen souls from material existence. I offer all respects unto them.

    паньча-таттва̄тмакам кришнам
        бгакта-рӯпа-сварӯпакам
    бгакта̄вата̄рам бгакта̄кхʼям
        нама̄мі бгакта-шяктікам

I offer my obeisances unto Lord Krishna in His fivefold aspect known as the pañcha-tattva: I offer my respects unto Śrī Gaurāṅgadev, who appears as a devotee of the Lord relishing His own internal mellows. Furthermore I bow down before Lord Nityānanda Prabhu, who is the self-same form and elder brother of Śrī Gaurāṅga. Next, I pay homage unto that great personality Śrī Advaita Prabhu, who is an incarnation of the Lord’s devotee, and unto the Lord’s eternal associates like Śrīvās Paṇḍit, who serve the Lord in loving devotional relationships. Finally, I bow down at the feet of those devotees who hold the actual potency of unalloyed dedication in their hands: Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya, Śrī Gadādhara Paṇḍit, and Śrī Swarūp Dāmodar.

    намо маха̄-вада̄ньяя
        кришна-према-прада̄я те
    кришна̄я кришна-чайтанья-
        на̄мне ґаура-твіше намах

I offer my obeisances unto Lord Gaurāṅga, whose divine complexion is a radiant golden hue and who possesses the qualities of the most benevolent incarnation. His spiritual Pastimes freely grant pure love for Lord Krishna to all. He is none other than Lord Krishna known in the age of Kali as Śrī Krishna Chaitanya.
