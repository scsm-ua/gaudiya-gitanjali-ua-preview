Śrī Chaitanyadeva is compared to that grand milk ocean which, after being churned, produced nectar. The nectar Mahāprabhu distributes is Lord Krishna’s Holy Names, which extinguish all the miseries of material existence, such as anxieties arising from sinful activities performed in direct opposition to the Lord, and the three-fold sufferings which fuel the grand forest fire that scorches those in search of sense gratification, salvation, and mystic yoga perfections.

Millions and millions of Cupids fall unconscious before the feet of Śrī Chaitanyadeva’s elegant figure. They are severely shocked because their sense of universal fame arising from their beautiful splendor is checked.

(The ‘fifth end’ refers to that which is beyond the attainment of religiosity, economic development, sense gratification, and liberation.) The Lord personally incarnated on the Earth planet with His expansions such as Nityānanda Prabhu and Advaita Āchārya, His intimate associates such as Gadādhara Paṇḍit, and His other general associates such as Śrīvāsa Ṭhākur. When the Lord appears, He comes armed with the weapon of the Holy Name of Krishna.

The controlling life-force of Lakṣmī Priyā Devī and Viṣṇu Priyā Devī was Śrī Gaurasundar, whose intelligence was couched in  deep parental adoration for His mother and father, Śachī Devī and Jagannāth Miśra.

Later, in the course of His adolescent Pastimes, the Lord vanquished the pride of the most famous Sanskrit scholar of all time, the Digvijayī Paṇḍit, in the company of His grammar students, on the banks of the Ganges River.

        "The grand intellectual Sārvabhauma tried his level best t oestablish the impersonal doctrine of Śaṅkarāchārya, which is in direct opposition to the conclusions of pure dedication. Sārvabhauma used the most deceitful means in the art of word jugglery. He tried to pervert the sense of words, he idly heckled the arguments or assertions of the Lord without attempting to prove the opposite side, and he tried to find the weak points in the Lord’s arguments. However, Śrī Chaitanya, whose charming figure was cloaked in the fresh garments of a radiant renunciate, presented consistent arguments in conjunction with the Vedic literatures, and easily checked and destroyed the scholar’s atheistic interpretations. The Lord loudly proclaimed that the doctrine of Śaṅkarāchārya is practiced by followers in the ascending method of understanding who are interested in their external selfadoration. Such worship is the product of a demoniac intellect and backed by atheistic perseverance. All importance given to the nonmanifest aspect of material nature was refuted when Lord Gaurasundar established that spiritual variegatedness in the Supreme Lord’s personality is the highest reality taught in the Vedic literature.",
        "This was shown in the Lord’s explanation of the Upaniṣads, where it is stated:",

        "Lord Gaurasundar also explained the ātmarāma verse which is found in the grandest of all famous literature, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. He clearly showed that the Vedas, Purāṇas, Vedānta, and all other existing Scriptures, which are like a magnificent temple where the Supreme Lord’s wonderful Pastimes are eternally resounded, support the conclusion that everything in this world is a reflection of the eternal variegatedness found in the spiritual realm.

Lord Chaitanya further revealed that the devotee in conjugal love known as *svakīya* only partially relishes the sweetness of this mellow, due to a tinge of scriptural etiquette.

Therefore, the cowherd boy Krishna, who is the original form of Lord Nārāyaṇa, and who attracts the heart of Lakṣmī Devī, is the Supreme Truth and the fundamental object of all devotional practices.

        "While strolling through the forest groves of Vṛndāvan, the Lord was joyfully welcomed by swarms of humming bumblebees busily engaged in discussion about pure love as they hovered over the blooming flowers. Millions of trees lining the forest groves harmoniously offered their respects unto Lord Gaurasundar in unison with a variety of birds that were expertly singing and dancing in sheer delight. The Lord’s mind became overflooded by loving feelings due to remembering how the cows, calves, and oxen of the holy abode of Vṛndāvan would affectionately call for Him in previous Pastimes, thereby elating His emotions in pure love.

Also, at the special request of a Maharastrian *brāhmaṇ* and Tapana Miśra and other devotees, the Lord destroyed the ignorant conception of the *māyāvādī* renunciates in Vārāṇasī. Lord Gaurāṅgadev personally met the impersonalists there in a public assembly, and pointed out that their mode of self-adoration was ultimately based on enviousness and narrow-mindedness.

But when considering the flow of dedication’s sweet mellows, Lord Gaurāṅga described the ultimate aspect of the Supreme Lord’s personality to be Śrī Gopījanavallabha, whose divine figure is the unlimited reservoir of all the primary and secondary mellows tasted in pure devotion. Śrī Gaurāṅga also hinted that the joyful and charming *rāsa-līlā* Pastimes are an allconscious reality, none other than the personal potency of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. Such transcendental Pastimes are found within the superexcellent and inconceivable spiritual world, and are the highest conception of spiritual existence, auspiciousness, and beauty. Lord Gaurāṅga suggested this to be the supreme achievable object of the living entities. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gaurāṅga Sundar, the divine form of Krishna-*prema*."

        "The eightfold symptoms depicting the moods of pure dedication would decorate and radiantly enhance the beauty of the Lord’s bodily parts. Sometimes He appeared like a tortoise who had withdrawn his limbs into his shell, and at other times His body appeared elongated due to His joints becoming dislocated. Sometimes Lord Gaurasundar’s figure was as tender and aromatic as a lotus flower. At other times the Lord’s body would appear red, yellow, or brilliant with the white hue of the jasmine flower. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gaurāṅga Sundar, the divine form of Krishna-*prema*."

Suddenly the Lord saw the reflection of the moon dancing upon the rolling waves. Unexpectedly, the Lord became overwhelmed by recollections of Lord Krishna’s Pastimes in the Yamunā River and fell unconscious. Next, Lord Gaurāṅga’s body, unseen by the devotees, became as light as a piece of dried wood and was gracefully carried away by the wind-god while lying upon the crest of the ocean’s rolling waves in a divine trance. Realizing Lord Krishna’s water-sport Pastimes in the Kālindī River with His dearmost cowherd-maiden friends, the Lord dove deep into an ocean of divine ecstasy.
